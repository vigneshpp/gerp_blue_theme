1. bench get-app https://github.com/hashirluv/bluetheme.git
2. bench --site (sitename) install-app bluetheme

For desktop icons to appear,
There are two files, named desktop-erpnext.py and desktop-frappe.py, in the <a href="https://github.com/hashirluv/bluetheme/releases"> releases</a> page. 
1. Rename the file desktop-erpnext.py to desktop.py and replace in frappe-bench/apps/erpnext/erpnext/config folder after taking the backup of the original file.
2. Rename the file desktop-frappe.py to desktop.py and replace in frappe-bench/apps/frappe/frappe/config folder after taking the backup of the original file.

### Troubleshoot Tips (not sure if it will work, but it worked for me)
If the installation of bluetheme doesn't work, or any error pops up, try 'get-app' again. If the error still persists,try the below. I'm not sure if it will work 100%, but it worked for me. 

1. Get another theme (i used "bench get-app https://github.com/vinhnguyent090/bdtheme")
2. Install it and uninstall it
3. Install bluetheme

** Please check the codes and help me refine it, in case the way i did the changes are not correct.
